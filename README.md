# AutoLISP Symbols Extension

## Description
The **AutoLISP OUTLINE Extension** for Visual Studio Code is designed to enhance your productivity when working with AutoLISP files. This extension automatically identifies symbols i.e., commands and functions defined using `defun` in `.lsp` files and displays them in the VSCode OUTLINE view.

This extension is specifically useful for AutoCAD users who work with AutoLISP files and want an organized way to view their defined commands and functions. It complements Autodesk's official AutoLISP extension by adding symbol support without overriding its syntax highlighting.

## Features
- Automatically detects `defun` symbols and displays them in the Outline view.
- Supports both command definitions `(defun c:commandName)` and regular function definitions `(defun functionName)`.
- Lightweight and easy to use, designed to work seamlessly with existing AutoLISP extensions.

## Installation
To install this extension:
1. Download and install the extension from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/sdfaheemuddin).
2. Open a `.lsp` file, and you should see the commands and functions listed in the Outline view.

## How to Use
1. Open any `.lsp` file in Visual Studio Code.
2. The extension will automatically detect commands and functions and display them in the **OUTLINE** view (located in the left sidebar).
3. Use the OUTLINE view to quickly navigate through your AutoLISP code.
